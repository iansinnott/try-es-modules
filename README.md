# Trying out ES6 Module syntax in Chrome

As of 2017-11-12 this works perfectly well in stable Chrome. Nice.

Of course, since this is not yet widely supported and HTTP2 isn't enabled to give us the network benefits of having separate files it is still going to make the most sense to use a bundler and babel or something like it. Still though, cool to see this working.
